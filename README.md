# disclaimer
This is a repo to make people aware that I am not claiming that all the code in all my repos is written from scratch.

I have used many many sources to write and I often utilise other people's code. My sources include GitHub, Stack Overflow, and many other open source services.

I have tried to reference all utilised code and I am happy to remove any code that is protected under license or if someone wishes for me to remove or alter something. I am also happy to give credit or remove other people's code so please email me if you wish to contact me for any complaints of changes that you wish to be made.
